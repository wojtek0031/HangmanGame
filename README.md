# HangmanGame
Good morning! Why I want to programming? 
Because I think it's very interesting, it's connected with new technologies which I like, and I'm always checking new devices or software apps.
I didn't finished all of tasks, so I think, I have little chance to be in Motorola Solutions Academy.
But believe me, I'm very creativ, I have logical and analithycal thinking, and the most important, I think, 
I'm very young, so it could be beginning of good colaboration.
All the best, greetings,
Wojciech Fronc
